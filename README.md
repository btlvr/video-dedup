# video-dedup

`video-dedup` is a tool similar to `rdfind`, but intented to work on video files. `rdfind` won't recognize two versions of the same video as duplicates if their checksums don't match entirely, which is never the case for videos that have been converted to other formats.

DISCLAIMER: this tool is very much still WIP
